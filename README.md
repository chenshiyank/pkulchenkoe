# Project Description

ZeroBrane Package is a collection of packages for [ZeroBrane Studio](http://studio.zerobrane.com).

You can find more information about ZeroBrane Studio packages and plugins in the [documentation](http://studio.zerobrane.com/doc-plugin.html).

## Installation

To install a plugin, copy its `.lua` file to `ZBS/packages/` or `HOME/.zbstudio/packages` folder
(where `ZBS` is the path to ZeroBrane Studio location and `HOME` is the path specified by the `HOME` environment variable).
The first location allows you to have per-instance plugins, while the second allows to have per-user plugins.
The second option may also be **preferrable for Mac OS X users** as the `packages/` folder may be overwritten during an application upgrade.
